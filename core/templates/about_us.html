                            In Week 7, we conducted trial runs and finalized preparations for a smooth transition into the construction phase of the solar-powered sluice box project. We performed a mock assembly of non-critical components to check part compatibility and identify issues, ran calibration trials on key systems like the solar setup, and refined the design based on insights from these tests. Additionally, we allocated roles and responsibilities within the team to ensure clarity and coordination moving forward. This week was crucial in ensuring we were ready to confidently begin construction in Week 8.
